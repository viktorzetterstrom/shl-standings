# Zetterstrom SHL standings

React app that displays the current SHL-standings, utilizing the open SHL api. I've written a layer on top of the api, see [shl-api](https://github.com/viktorzetterstrom/shl-api).

Currently the app displays the current SHL standings and some statistics regarding players and teams.

Everything is up and running on [shl.zetterstrom.dev](https://shl.zetterstrom.dev).
