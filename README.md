# Zetterstrom SHL standings

React app that displays the current SHL-standings, utilizing the open SHL api. I've written a layer on top of the api, see [shl-api](https://github.com/viktorzetterstrom/shl-api).

Currently the app displays the current SHL standings, current features are in the pipeline:

- Tab for top scorers
- Tab for top goalies
- Tab for team win-streaks
- Tab for win/lose-ratios last 3, 5, 7 games

Everything is up and running on [shl.zetterstrom.dev](https://shl.zetterstrom.dev).
